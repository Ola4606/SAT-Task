# Adeyemo OlaOluwa's solution to the SAT task for a Junior Software Engineer
## Tech Stack: Node.JS

## To run the API's code:

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in production mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000/calculateDisselUsageForDistance?distance=120&yearOfProduction=2012&fuelUsagePer100KM=2](http://localhost:3000/calculateDisselUsageForDistance?distance=120&yearOfProduction=2012&fuelUsagePer100KM=2) to test the 1st API function that calculates how much disel is consumed by the PeopleCar PasWagon C6 for a particular distance travelled in KM, in the browser with those query parameters.\

or

Open [http://localhost:3000/probabilityOfUnitInjectorFail?VIN=1234](http://localhost:3000/probabilityOfUnitInjectorFail?VIN=1234) to test the 1st API function that returns a random percentage of the chance that the engine of the PeopleCar PasWagon C6 will fail, in the browser with those query parameters.\

`Note:` The query parameters can be changed to pass different values to the API 

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000/calculateDisselUsageForDistance?distance=120&yearOfProduction=2012&fuelUsagePer100KM=2](http://localhost:3000/calculateDisselUsageForDistance?distance=120&yearOfProduction=2012&fuelUsagePer100KM=2) to test the 1st API function that calculates how much disel is consumed by the PeopleCar PasWagon C6 for a particular distance travelled in KM, in the browser with those query parameters.\

or

Open [http://localhost:3000/probabilityOfUnitInjectorFail?VIN=1234](http://localhost:3000/probabilityOfUnitInjectorFail?VIN=1234) to test the 1st API function that returns a random percentage of the chance that the engine of the PeopleCar PasWagon C6 will fail, in the browser with those query parameters.\
